The wxi library provides a functional-style interface on top of wxErlang. It heavily borrows ideas from Haskell GUI library Fudgets.

This is a work in progress, but if you are interested feel free to contact me at golubovsky at gmail dot com, or post to the Erlang Programming mailing list at erlang-questions at erlang dot org.
