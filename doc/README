The wxErlang library (Erlang bindings for wxWidgets) is now official part of Erlang/OTP. 
The library itself exposes a low-level imperative interface. 
The wxi library provides a functional-style interface on top of wxErlang. 
It heavily borrows ideas from Haskell GUI library Fudgets. 

To try it out:

1. Change to the toplevel directory of the library
2. Start Erlang shell.
3. Execute make:all([load]).
4. Execute wxitest:start().

The latter command brings up the minimal demo program.

To regenerate documentation, run in the Erlang shell:

edoc:application(wxi, '.', []).
